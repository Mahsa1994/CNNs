# CNNs
The CNNs repository is a collection of python codes used for training deep convolutional neural networks. The repository's primary focus is on implementing and experimenting with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Python.

## How to train?
Before running the `train.py` script in the CNNs repository, you'll need to specify some hyperparameters within the script. `train.py` is the primary training script for the CNN models, responsible for training the model on a specific dataset, validating the model with specified validation data, and saving the trained model to a specified location. Additionally, the script allows for hyperparameter tuning, enabling you to adjust the model's parameters and fine-tune it to get better results.
